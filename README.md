# MathGame 2.0

Includes 3-in-1 game!

A math game made for my assignment --- feel free to use.

Hello! This is Syamsul Hilmi aka Triff and I made a math game where you have to choose two numbers that equals to the the answer above.
This program is mostly made from my lecturer's tutoral (please check his video out!): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSbocNW7EXE. (Video is in Indonesian language.)
