# MathGame 2.0

# STILL ON DEVELOPMENT! Only two games are working as of now

(readme below taken from the first project)

A math game made for my assignment --- feel free to use.

Hello! This is Syamsul Hilmi aka Triff and I made a math game where you have to choose two numbers that equals to the the answer above.
This program is mostly made from my lecturer's tutoral (please check his video out!): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSbocNW7EXE. (Video is in Indonesian language.)

There is one slight difference, there are actually two answers instead of one answer.

# How it works

1. The player will be on this screen.

2. You will click two buttons for the answer input.
3a. If the inputs are equal to the answer above, your score will be increased by one.

3b. Else, if it's wrong, you won't get any score.

4. If the timer runs out, the score will be shown.
